# SGT Chatwork Bot Thinh

A modular, extensible chatbot for SGT Team that responds to mentions in Chatwork rooms and performs predefined actions.

## Key Features

- Mention-based interaction
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- GPT-3.5 powered command interpretation
- Asynchronous processing with Celery

## Quick Start with Makefile

This project includes a Makefile to simplify common development tasks. Here are some useful commands:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   make build
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```
   make up
   ```

3. Stop the application:
   ```
   make down
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```
   make test
   ```

5. Access the container shell:
   ```
   make connect
   ```

6. View application logs:
   ```
   make logs
   ```

Remember to set up your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables before running these commands. Refer to the
`.env.example` file for the required variables.

## How to Add a New Action

1. Create `src/actions/action_<your_action_name>.py`
2. Define a new class inheriting from `Action`:

```python
from src.actions.action_decorator import Action, ActionRegistry
from src.utils.web_utils import WebHelper


@ActionRegistry.register('your_action_name', 'Description of your action')
class YourActionClass(Action):
    def execute(self, room_id: str, account_id: str, message: str, web_helper: WebHelper) -> str:
        # Implement your action logic here
        return "Your action response"
```

3. The `@ActionRegistry.register` decorator automatically registers your action.
4. Implement your logic in the `execute` method.
5. Return a string as the response.
6. Your new action is now available in Chatwork using the registered command name.

### Parameter Explanations:

- `your_action_name`: The command name users will use to trigger your action in Chatwork.
  Example: 'weather_forecast'
- `Description of your action`: A brief explanation of what your action does.
  Example: 'Get the weather forecast for a specified city'
- `room_id`: The ID of the Chatwork room where the action was triggered.
- `account_id`: The ID of the Chatwork user who triggered the action.
- `message`: The full message content that triggered the action.
- `web_helper`: An instance of the WebHelper class for making web requests.

For more details on using the WebHelper class, refer to the [WebHelper.md](./WebHelper.md) file.
